# Machine Learning
This repository contains the work for the Machine Learning course.

In the ISI program at UASLP.

## Content
This respository is organized by partials and includes:

### **1st Partial: Regression and Kernel Methods**
- **Kernel Methods**
  - Comparison of various regression models.
  - Dataset and example time-series with kernels.
  - Implementation in Python and related documentation.
- **Regression Algorithms**
  - Polynomial regression, linear regression, and Fourier-based regression.
  - Parameter estimation for regression models (C and Python implementations).
  - Bias-variance trade-off in nonlinear data.

### **2nd Partial: Classification Algorithms and Deep Learning**
- **Classification Algorithms**
  - Decision trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
  - Comparisons of classifiers using different datasets.
- **Deep Learning & Neural Networks**
  - Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN).
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Keras.
  - Deep Neural Networks (DNN) examples and practical guides.

### **3rd Partial: Clustering and Advanced Topics**
- **Clustering Methods**
  - Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), k-Means, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).
  - Reports and visualizations for clustering methods.
- **IBM and Practical Applications**
  - Images and datasets used for real-world clustering applications.
